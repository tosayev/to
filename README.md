# My personal website built with [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton)
I have used Skeleton for a lot of websites that I have developed since it's a very easy-to-use and light framework.  Even the design of their landing page is inspiring & matches my taste.

I built this one-page, very basic, static website to display my profile & experience.  I added some custom CSS on top of the base stylesheet from [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton).

The only "interesting" part about the website is the form which was built with [Formpsree](https://formspree.io).  Formspree is a fantastic, free (with a premium option), tool to create, deploy and manage website forms.  It offers free reCaptcha to protect against spam and bots.

I deployed the website with a custom domain on Github Pages since it offers free hosting (and I do not wish to spend too much money on a personal website that will not be generating any profit).
